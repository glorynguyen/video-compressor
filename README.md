# Video Compression Script

A simple, cross-platform script to compress video files using `ffmpeg` and `zenity`. The script provides a graphical interface for selecting a video file, compressing it, and saving the compressed version.

## Features

- **Cross-platform**: Supports Homebrew (macOS) and APT (Linux) for package management.
- **Graphical Interface**: Uses `zenity` for a simple file selection and progress dialog.
- **Video Compression**: Uses `ffmpeg` to compress videos into `.mov` format with customizable settings.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- `ffmpeg`: A powerful multimedia processing tool.
- `zenity`: A GTK+ dialog box for creating graphical user interfaces.

### Installation

#### 1. **Install Dependencies**

The script will automatically check for the package manager (either Homebrew or APT) and install the required dependencies.

- **Homebrew (macOS)**: `ffmpeg` and `zenity` will be installed via Homebrew.
- **APT (Linux)**: `ffmpeg` and `zenity` will be installed via APT.

The script will attempt to install these packages if they are not already installed.

#### 2. **Run the Script**

Simply execute the script in a terminal:

```bash
chmod +x video_compress.sh
./video_compress.sh
```

### Web Version
Iâ€™ve also ported the video compression tool to a web version, which you can use at:

Please note that the web version may take longer to convert due to the use of WebAssembly (WASM) for video processing.
